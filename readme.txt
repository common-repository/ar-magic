BZ9, Aweber, Getresponse and Mailchimp autoresponder management.

== Description ==
Autoresponder Magic stores unlimited autoresponder embed codes so that you get to use convenient short code within the html editors. This has major benefits as follows:

Feature #1: Instantly swaps optin forms site wide for when you need to change offer or target list

Feature #2: Keeps your leads signing up during autoresponder downtime ... even notorious DDoS attacks, by instantly swapping service provider site wide with just one simple change.

Feature #3: Stops the annoying and time consuming occurrence of word press html editors removing autoresponder code when moving between the text and visual tabs.

Autoresponder magic really is a time saver, a money saver, an aggravation saver and potentially a business saver which every word press and autoresponder user Needs.
